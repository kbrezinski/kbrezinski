Hi there :wave: My name is Kenneth Brezinski, I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Manitoba. My research focuses on the development and application of machine learning techniques for pre-emptive cyber security defense. I am currently Intern Lead for a multi-year collaboration with Canadian Tire Corporation. My long term goals include working as a Machine Learning Engineering and leading my own projects over a wide variety of industries. 

I have a personal blog where I write about Politics, Life and Human Intelligence. A link will be added once the transition to a new server is made.

### My other research focus areas:

:point_right: Tribal Topology for Particle Swarm Optimization [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDp48-GkkeA&t=599s) 

:point_right: Complexity Analysis for Feature Extraction

The bulk of my code base is not added to Github yet, and may or may not be added depending on what is proprietary for my research or not.
